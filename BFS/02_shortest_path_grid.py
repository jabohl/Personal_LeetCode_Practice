Problem: Shortest Path in a Grid (0/1 Matrix)
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/

Description:
Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.
The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

        Solve using multi-source BFS.
        
        Approach:
        1. Start BFS from all 0 cells simultaneously (multi-source BFS)
        2. Use a queue to track cells and their distances
        3. For each cell, explore all 4 adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
        4. Mark visited cells to avoid revisiting
        
        Time Complexity: O(m * n) where m and n are dimensions of the matrix
        Space Complexity: O(m * n) for the queue and distance matrix
